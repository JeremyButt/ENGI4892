Worst case senario: 
	RM_all();
		- while loop to see if all node have been deleted (not through all items {not N})
			-findItemAddress(one loop though list {N items})
			-finditemPosition(one loop through list {N items})
			-deleteAt(loop to position in list {N items})

2 layers of loops evident however only one is looping through N items at a time, therefore time complexity is O(2N) 
which means O(N).
